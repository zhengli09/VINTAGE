Description: VINTAGE assesses the complexity of the gene-trait relationship 
  from two distinct angles, using two separate statistical tests -- a genetic 
  variance test that examines the joint effects of multiple SNPs in a gene 
  region on the trait; and a genetic correlation test that examines the
  potential mediation effects of gene expression. VINTAGE explicitly quantifies 
  and tests the proportion of genetic effects on a trait potentially mediated 
  through gene expression using a local genetic correlation test, and further 
  leverages such information to guide the integration of gene expression mapping 
  study towards gene association mapping in GWAS through a genetic variance test.
